[IMPORTANT]
====
üö® **CRITICAL**: This guide helps you properly clean up all Confluent Cloud resources created during the workshop to **prevent unexpected charges**. 

**Execute these steps immediately after completing the workshop** to avoid ongoing costs from Flink compute pools, Tableflow catalog integrations, and other billable resources.
====

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to safely tear down all workshop resources and prevent accidental billing.

toc::[]

== üéØ Teardown Objectives

By the end of this teardown process, you will have:

* ‚úÖ Stopped all running Flink applications and compute pools
* ‚úÖ Deleted Tableflow catalog integrations and materialized tables
* ‚úÖ Removed HTTP Source Connectors
* ‚úÖ Cleaned up API keys and access credentials
* ‚úÖ Deleted Kafka topics and cluster (optional)
* ‚úÖ Removed the workshop environment (optional)
* ‚úÖ Verified no ongoing charges

== ‚è±Ô∏è Time Allocation

* **High-Priority Cleanup (Cost-Critical)**: 8 minutes
* **Standard Resource Cleanup**: 5 minutes
* **Final Verification**: 2 minutes

== üö® High-Priority Cleanup - Stop Billing Immediately (8 minutes)

These resources generate the highest costs and should be deleted **first and immediately**:

=== Stop All Flink Applications and Compute Pools

[source,bash]
----
# 1. List and stop all running Flink statements/applications
confluent flink statement list

# Stop each running statement (replace STATEMENT_ID with actual IDs)
confluent flink statement stop $FLINK_STATEMENT_ID

# Delete all Flink statements
confluent flink statement delete $FLINK_STATEMENT_ID

# 2. Stop and delete Flink compute pools
confluent flink compute-pool list

# Delete the compute pool
confluent flink compute-pool delete --force $FLINK_POOL_ID
----

[WARNING]
====
**Flink compute pools charge by CFU-hours even when idle**. Deleting them immediately stops all charges.
====

=== Delete Tableflow Resources

[source,bash]
----
# Load environment variables
cd ./scripts/kafka
source .env

# 1. Disable Tableflow for all workshop topics
confluent tableflow topic disable crypto-prices --force --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent tableflow topic disable price-alerts --force --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent tableflow topic disable crypto-trends --force --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent tableflow topic disable crypto-prices-exploded --force --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# 2. List and verify Tableflow topics are disabled
confluent tableflow topic list --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# 3. Delete Tableflow API keys if created
confluent api-key list
confluent api-key delete --force $TABLEFLOW_API_KEY
----

[WARNING]
====
**Tableflow catalog integrations incur storage and compute costs**. Delete them immediately after stopping materialization.
====

=== Verify High-Priority Resources Deleted

[source,bash]
----
# Verify Flink resources are gone
confluent flink compute-pool list
confluent flink statement list

# Verify Tableflow resources are gone
confluent tableflow topic list

# Expected output: Empty lists or "No resources found"
----

== üßπ Standard Resource Cleanup (5 minutes)

After stopping the high-cost resources, clean up remaining components:

=== Delete Connectors

[source,bash]
----
# Load environment variables
cd ./scripts/kafka
source .env

# List all connectors
confluent connect cluster list
confluent connect cluster list --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# Delete the HTTP source connector
confluent connect cluster delete --cluster $CC_CONNECT_CLUSTER

# Verify deletion
confluent connect cluster list --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
----

=== Clean Up API Keys

[source,bash]
----
# List all API keys in the environment
confluent api-key list

# Delete workshop-related API keys (keep only what you need)
confluent api-key delete $KAFKA_API_KEY
confluent api-key delete $SCHEMA_REGISTRY_API_KEY

# Verify remaining keys
confluent api-key list
----

=== Delete Kafka Topics (Optional)

[CAUTION]
====
[source,bash]
----
# Load environment variables
cd ./scripts/kafka
source .env

# Delete all workshop topics
confluent kafka topic delete crypto-prices --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent kafka topic delete price-alerts --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent kafka topic delete crypto-prices-exploded --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent kafka topic delete crypto-trends --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
confluent kafka topic delete latest-prices --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# Verify deletion
confluent kafka topic list --cluster $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
----

=== Delete Kafka Cluster (Optional)

[NOTE]
====
**Basic clusters are free**, but you may want to delete for organization. **Standard/Dedicated clusters incur charges**.
====

[source,bash]
----
# Check cluster type first
confluent kafka cluster describe $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# If it's a Standard or Dedicated cluster, delete immediately:
confluent kafka cluster delete $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER

# For Basic clusters (optional cleanup):
confluent kafka cluster delete $CC_KAFKA_CLUSTER
----

== üóÇÔ∏è Environment Cleanup (Optional)

=== Delete Workshop Environment

[CAUTION]
====
**Environment Deletion**: This removes the entire environment and all contained resources. Only do this if you created a dedicated workshop environment.
====

[source,bash]
----
# List environments
confluent environment list

# Switch to a different environment first (use your default environment)
confluent environment use <OTHER_ENV_ID>

# Delete the workshop environment
confluent environment delete $CC_ENV_ID

# Verify deletion
confluent environment list
----

== ‚úÖ Final Verification and Cost Monitoring (2 minutes)

=== Verify All Resources Deleted

[TIP]
====
**Quick Validation**: Use the automated validation script for comprehensive resource checking:
[source,bash]
----
# Run the automated validation script
./scripts/setup/validate-teardown.sh
----
This script provides colored output, detailed resource analysis, and cost impact assessment.
====

**Manual Verification** (if needed):

[source,bash]
----
# Check for any remaining billable resources
echo "üîç Checking for remaining billable resources..."

# Flink resources (should be empty)
echo "Flink Compute Pools:"
confluent flink compute-pool list

echo "Flink Statements:"
confluent flink statement list

# Tableflow resources (should be empty)
echo "Tableflow Catalog Integrations:"
confluent tableflow catalog-integration list

echo "Tableflow Topics:"
confluent tableflow topic list

# Connectors (should be empty or only non-workshop connectors)
echo "Connectors:"
confluent connect connector list

# Clusters (Basic clusters are free, but check for Standard/Dedicated)
echo "Kafka Clusters:"
confluent kafka cluster list
----

=== Monitor Billing Dashboard

[source,bash]
----
# Open Confluent Cloud Console to verify billing
echo "üåê Please verify in Confluent Cloud Console:"
echo "1. Go to: https://confluent.cloud"
echo "2. Navigate to: Billing & Payment ‚Üí Usage"
echo "3. Verify: No active Flink or Tableflow charges"
echo "4. Check: Only Basic cluster (free) or expected resources remain"
----

== üí∞ Cost Prevention Best Practices

=== Immediate Actions After Workshop

1. **Set up billing alerts** in Confluent Cloud Console
2. **Review usage daily** for the first week after workshop
3. **Delete unused environments** regularly
4. **Monitor API key usage** and delete unused keys

=== Ongoing Cost Management

[TIP]
====
**Use the validation script regularly** to monitor your Confluent Cloud resources:
[source,bash]
----
# Run weekly cost checks
./scripts/validate-teardown.sh
----
====

== üö® Emergency Cleanup Script

If you need to quickly delete everything:

[source,bash]
----
# Emergency cleanup script - USE WITH CAUTION
cat > ~/emergency-cleanup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "üö® EMERGENCY CONFLUENT CLOUD CLEANUP"
echo "This will delete ALL workshop resources!"
read -p "Are you sure? Type 'DELETE' to continue: " confirm

if [ "$confirm" != "DELETE" ]; then
    echo "Cleanup cancelled."
    exit 1
fi

echo "üßπ Starting emergency cleanup..."

# Stop and delete all Flink resources
echo "Cleaning Flink resources..."
for statement in $(confluent flink statement list --output json | jq -r '.[].name' 2>/dev/null); do
    confluent flink statement delete "$statement" --force
done

for pool in $(confluent flink compute-pool list --output json | jq -r '.[].id' 2>/dev/null); do
    confluent flink compute-pool delete "$pool" --force
done

# Delete all Tableflow resources
echo "Cleaning Tableflow resources..."
for topic in $(confluent tableflow topic list --output json | jq -r '.[].name' 2>/dev/null); do
    confluent tableflow topic delete "$topic" --force
done

for catalog in $(confluent tableflow catalog-integration list --output json | jq -r '.[].id' 2>/dev/null); do
    confluent tableflow catalog-integration delete "$catalog" --force
done

# Delete connectors
echo "Cleaning connectors..."
for connector in $(confluent connect connector list --output json | jq -r '.[].name' 2>/dev/null); do
    confluent connect connector delete "$connector"
done

echo "‚úÖ Emergency cleanup completed!"
echo "üåê Please verify in Confluent Cloud Console that all resources are deleted."
EOF

chmod +x ~/emergency-cleanup.sh

== üìã Teardown Checklist

Before considering the teardown complete, verify:

**High-Priority (Cost-Critical)**:
- [ ] All Flink compute pools deleted
- [ ] All Flink applications/statements stopped and deleted
- [ ] All Tableflow catalog integrations deleted
- [ ] All Tableflow materialized tables deleted

**Standard Cleanup**:
- [ ] HTTP Source Connectors deleted
- [ ] Workshop API keys deleted
- [ ] Workshop topics deleted (if desired)
- [ ] Kafka cluster deleted (if Standard/Dedicated tier)

**Verification**:
- [ ] Billing dashboard shows no unexpected charges
- [ ] Cost monitoring script runs clean
- [ ] All workshop resources confirmed deleted

== üîß Troubleshooting Teardown Issues

=== Cannot Delete Flink Compute Pool

[source,bash]
----
# Force stop all applications first
confluent flink statement list
confluent flink statement stop <STATEMENT_ID> --force

# Wait a few minutes, then try deleting the pool
confluent flink compute-pool delete <POOL_ID> --force
----

=== Cannot Delete Tableflow Catalog Integration

[source,bash]
----
# Delete all materialized tables first
confluent tableflow topic list
confluent tableflow topic delete <TABLE_NAME> --force

# Delete API keys
confluent tableflow api-key list
confluent tableflow api-key delete <API_KEY>

# Then delete catalog integration
confluent tableflow catalog-integration delete <CATALOG_ID> --force
----

=== Connector Deletion Fails

[source,bash]
----
# Check connector status
confluent connect connector describe <CONNECTOR_NAME>

# Force delete if stuck
confluent connect connector delete <CONNECTOR_NAME> --force

# If still failing, contact support with connector ID
----

=== Unexpected Charges Appearing

1. **Immediately run the emergency cleanup script**
2. **Check Confluent Cloud Console billing section**
3. **Contact Confluent Support** with your organization ID
4. **Document all resources** you believe should be deleted
